# Aptogotchi Random Mint

We have a tutorial based on this repo at [Aptos Learn](https://learn.aptoslabs.com/), go check it out!

## Difference from [Aptogotchi beginner](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptogotchi)

This is a simplified version that only keeps minting function, it uses On-Chain randomness to determine the look of Aptogotchi at minting instead of manually setting it, and each address can mint as many Aptogotchis as possible instead of 1 per address.

## Prerequisite

The module is deployed to [devnet](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/?network=devnet).
